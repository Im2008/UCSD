        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <p> Overall, there isn't that much stuff I do outside of interest and hobbies.
            Usually I do them during my freetime, but wouldn't consider them a hobby since
            I do them pretty inconsistently compared to the other stuff that is listed in Hobbies.
            For example, i'm starting to code more than I woud with playing basketball.
