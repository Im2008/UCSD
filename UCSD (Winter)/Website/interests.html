        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <p> I'm pretty interested in a lot of stuff, however I don't do them that often mostly
            due to the amount of time it'll take and the difficulty by which i'm not up to par yet.
            This includes Arcitecture & Software Creating which looks complicated enough for me not
            to attempt yet.
